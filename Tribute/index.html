Thereafter, he pursued a course in commerce at Kirori Mal College, Delhi. After his graduation, he relocated to Mumbai, Maharashtra, where he embarked on his career as a singer. KK was a vocalist since childhood and grew up participating in competitions and rock bands in school and college. In an interview, he revealed that he enrolled in a music class for a while during his childhood, but as he had never felt the need to learn music, he quit. He said,
                
                <br><br>"I went there only for three days. I hated it because for me music had no boundaries and I couldn’t understand why one needed to learn singing. So I left, and I never went back.”</p>
                <p>Before venturing into the music industry, he worked in the marketing department in the hotel industry for a while, and then he moved to Mumbai. After numerous frustrating attempts to break into the Bollywood music circuit, KK secured the opportunity to work as a jingle singer when he presented his demo tapes to Louis Banks, Ranjit Barot and Lesle Lewis in 1994. Soon, he got a break from UTV, and he sang a one-minute jingle for Santogen Suitings.</p>
                <p>He had sung over 3,500 jingles in eleven Indian languages including Yo Frooti and Pepsi’s Yeh Dil Mange More. KK also lent his voice to the song ‘Josh of India’ for the support of the Indian Cricket Team during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.</p>
                <p>KK made his Bollywood debut as a playback singer with Indian music composer Vishal Bhardwaj‘s song ‘Chhod Aaye Hum Galiyan Chhod Aaye Hum’ in the action drama film Maachis (1996). The song was collaboratively sung by Hariharan, Suresh Wadkar, Vinod Sehgal, and KK. In 1999, KK gained popularity with A.R. Rahman’s chartbuster soundtrack ‘Tadap Tadap,’ featured in the film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Another crowd puller song voiced by him is “Koi Kahe Kehta Rahe” from the 2001 coming-of-age film ‘Dil Chahta Hai;’ the song was collaboratively voiced by Shankar Mahadevan, Shaan, and KK.

                <p>On 31 May 2022, he died of a suspected cardiac arrest after reaching his hotel, following a performance at Nazrul Mancha auditorium in Kolkata. Reportedly, around 10.30 p.m., when the singer reached his hotel, he complained of feeling unwell following which he was rushed to a city hospital, where he was declared brought dead. However, the Kolkata Police registered it as an unnatural death case.

He was cremated at Versova Hindu Cemetery, Mumbai.</p>
